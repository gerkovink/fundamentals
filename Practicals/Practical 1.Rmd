Today we will get acquainted with `R`. A convenient way to work with `R` is with `RStudio`, as `RStudio` adds many features and convenient accessibility options to the plain `R` you have obtained from http://r-project.org. Most of these features go beyond the scope of this course, but as you will develop your `R` skillset, you might run into the need for `RStudio` at a later moment. Best to get to know `RStudio` now. 
 
If you have no experience with `R`, you will learn the most from following this document. If you have some experience with `R` already,  I suggest you try solving the questions without looking at the answers/walkthrough. You can then refer to the solutions at any time, if needed. 

If you have any questions or if you feel that some code should be elaborated, feel free to ask.


---

We start with the very basics and will move towards more advanced operations in `R`. First we will get acquainted with the language (which is called `S` - to keep it simple) and the environment we work in. 

---

## Exercises

`R` is an object oriented language. This means that elements, such as numbers or characters, are assigned to objects. The below code block assigns the value `1` to object `a`. 

```{r}
# This is the first exercise
a <- 1
```

The `#` tells `R` that everything that follows in that specific line is not to be considered as code. In other words, you can use `#` to comment in your own `R`-scripts. I used `#` here to elaborate that the following line is the code from exercise 1. 

The line `a <- 1` assigns the value `1` to object `a`. When you run your code, it will be saved. The value 1 and the letter `a` are chosen to illustrate assigning in `R`. You might as well assign `123` to `banana` if you like. Really, anything goes. 

---

### 1. Run the below code example and see what happens. 

```{r assigning, exercise = TRUE}
# This is the first exercise
a <- 1
a
```

---

### 2. Add the following to the above code example:

- assign the value `2` to object `b`
- evaluate object `b`, just like object `a` is evaluated in the above example
- multiply objects `a` and `b` (Hint: use `*` as the multiplier symbol)
- store the result of `a * b` in object `c`
- take the square root of object `c` (use `sqrt(c)`)

---

### 3. Two questions to evaluate your progress.

```{r letter-a, echo=FALSE}
question("The square root of object `c` is",
  answer("1.414214", correct = TRUE),
  answer("1", message = "You calculated the `sqrt(a)`, not the `sqrt(c)`"),
  answer("Error: object 'b' not found", message = "You forgot to run/evaluate the code that generates object `b`"),
  answer("Error in sqrt(c) : non-numeric argument to mathematical function", message = "You forgot to run/evaluate the code that generates object `c`")
)
``` 
```{r letter-b, echo=FALSE}
question("After each code change, the code needs to be re-evaluated for the changes to take effect",
  answer("FALSE"),
  answer("TRUE", correct = TRUE)
)
```

---

### 4. Square `a`
```{r squaring, exercise = TRUE}
a <- 1
a^2
```

Still 1, that's nice!

---

### 5. Create a new `b` and assign `a+a`. Check if `b` is indeed `a+a`. 
```{r evaluating, exercise = TRUE}
a <- 1
b <- a + a
b == a + a
```

`True!` R is telling us that the equality we tested is indeed true. In other 
words, everything before the == is equal to that which is posed after the ==. 
Now we are talking.  Our previous `b` with value `2` is now effectively overwritten. 

---

### 6. Square `b`, multiply the answer with $\frac{a}{b}$ and call the result `c`. Then, take the square root of $c^b$ and multiply it with $\frac{a}{b^6}$. 
```{r multiplying, exercise = TRUE}
a <- 1
b <- a + a
c <- b^2 * (a / b)
sqrt(c^b) * (a / b^6)
```

Nice! But anything beyond a couple of decimals may not be relevant. 

---

### 7. Round the answer from the previous exercise to 3 decimals.
```{r rounding, exercise = TRUE}
a <- 1
b <- a + a
c <- b^2 * (a / b)
round(sqrt(c^b) * (a / b^6), digits = 3)
```

or, alternatively
```{r rounding2, exercise = TRUE}
a <- 1
b <- a + a
c <- b^2 * (a / b)
d <- sqrt(c^b) * (a / b^6)
round(d, digits = 3)
```


Do you notice that the first solution is shorter, but the second is much more 
insightful? If you share your code, or plan to use it later on, clarity is of
great importance. A small effort now, saves you hours later. 

Now you know how to use `R` as a calculator and `R-Studio` as a typesetting 
device.
