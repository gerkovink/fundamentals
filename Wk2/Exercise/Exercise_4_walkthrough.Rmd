# Exercises

The following packages are required for this practical:
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(mice)
```
and if you'd like the same results as I have obtained, you can fix the random seed
```{r}
set.seed(123)
```

---

## Exercise 1-5

---

1. **Use a pipe to do the following:**

- draw 1000 values from a normal distribution with `mean = 5` and `sd = 1` - $N(5, 1)$, 
- create a matrix where the first 500 values are the first column and the second 500 values are the second column
- make a scatterplot of these two columns
```{r}
rnorm(1000, 5) %>%
  matrix(ncol = 2) %>%
  plot()
```

---

2. **Use a pipe to calculate the correlation matrix on the `anscombe` data set**

```{r}
anscombe %>%
  cor()
```

---

3. **Now use a pipe to calculate the correlation for the pair (`x4`, `y4`) on the `anscombe` data set**

Using the standard `%>%` pipe:
```{r}
anscombe %>%
  subset(select = c(x4, y4)) %>%
  cor()
```
Alternatively, we can use the `%$%` pipe from package `magrittr` to make this process much more efficient.
```{r}
anscombe %$%
  cor(x4, y4)
```

---

4. **Use a pipe to calculate the correlation between `hgt` and `wgt` in the `boys` data set from package `mice`.**

Because `boys` has missings values for almost all variables, we must first select `wgt` and `hgt` and then omit the rows that have missing values, before we can calculate the correlation. Using the standard `%>%` pipe, this would look like:
```{r}
boys %>%
  subset(select = c("wgt", "hgt")) %>%
  cor(use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
```
which is equivalent to 
```{r}
boys %>%
  subset(select = c("wgt", "hgt")) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  cor()
```

Alternatively, we can use the `%$%` pipe:
```{r}
boys %$% 
  cor(hgt, wgt, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
```
The `%$%` pipe *unfolds* the listed dimensions of the `boys` dataset, such that we can refer to them directly. 

---

5. **In the `boys` data set, `hgt` is recorded in centimeters. Use a pipe to transform `hgt` in the `boys` dataset to height in meters and verify the transformation**

Using the standard `%>%` and the `%$%` pipes:
```{r}
boys %>%
  transform(hgt = hgt / 100) %$%
  mean(hgt, na.rm = TRUE)
```

---

## Exercise 6-6

---

6. **Use a pipe to plot the pair (`hgt`, `wgt`) two times: once for `hgt` in meters and once for `hgt` in centimeters. Make the points in the 'centimeter' plot `red` and in the 'meter' plot `blue`. **

This is best done with the `%T>%` pipe:
```{r}
boys %>%
  subset(select = c(hgt, wgt)) %T>%
  plot(col = "red", main = "Height in centimeters") %>%
  transform(hgt = hgt / 100) %>%
  plot(col = "blue", main = "Height in meters")
```

The `%T>%` pipe is very useful, because it creates a literal `T` junction in the pipe. It is perhaps most informative to graphically represent the above pipe as follows:
```{r eval=FALSE}
boys %>%
  subset(select = c(hgt, wgt)) %T>%
  plot(col = "red", main = "Height in centimeters") %>%
  transform(hgt = hgt / 100) %>%
  plot(col = "blue", main = "Height in meters")
```
![](flow_t_pipe.png)

We can see that there is indeed a literal T-junction. Naturally, we can expand this process with more `%T>%` pipes. However, once a pipe gets too long or too complicated, it is perhaps more useful to cut the piped problem into smaller, manageble pieces.
